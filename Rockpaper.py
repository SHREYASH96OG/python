AI, ML, and Data Science dominate many fields and industries today - all of them make heavy use of the Python programming language in some way or another. 

Becoming a master in Python can open many doors in your career and land in some of the best opportunities across the planet. No matter wherever you rate yourself in the Python skill, working on Python projects is a surefire way to boost your skills and build up your profile. While Python books and Python tutorials are helpful, nothing beats getting your hands dirty with actual coding.

We list several Python projects for beginners for you to challenge yourself and get better at Python coding.

 

Top 10 Python Project Ideas for Beginners
1. Mad Libs Generator 
This Python beginner project is a good start for beginners as it makes use of strings, variables, and concatenation. The Mad Libs Generator manipulates input data, which could be anything: an adjective, a pronoun, or verb. After taking in the input, the program takes the data and arranges it to build a story. This is a very cool Python project to try out if you’re new to coding.

Sample Code:

""" Mad Libs Generator

----------------------------------------

"""

#Loop back to this point once code finishes

loop = 1

while (loop < 10):

# All the questions that the program asks the user

noun = input("Choose a noun: ")

p_noun = input("Choose a plural noun: ")

noun2 = input("Choose a noun: ")

place = input("Name a place: ")

adjective = input("Choose an adjective (Describing word): ")

noun3 = input("Choose a noun: ")

#Displays the story based on the users input

print ("------------------------------------------")

print ("Be kind to your",noun,"- footed", p_noun)

print ("For a duck may be somebody's", noun2,",")

print ("Be kind to your",p_noun,"in",place)

print ("Where the weather is always",adjective,".")

print ()

print ("You may think that is this the",noun3,",")

print ("Well it is.")

print ("------------------------------------------")

# Loop back to "loop = 1"

loop = loop + 1
 

2. Number Guessing 
This project is a fun game that generates a random number in a certain specified range and the user must guess the number after receiving hints. Every time a user’s guess is wrong they are prompted with more hints to make it easier — at the cost of reducing the score.

The program also requires functions to check if an actual number is entered by the user, and finds the difference between the two numbers. 

Sample Code:


""" Number Guessing Game

----------------------------------------

"""

import random

attempts_list = []

def show_score():

if len(attempts_list) <= 0:

print("There is currently no high score, it's yours for the taking!")

else:

print("The current high score is {} attempts".format(min(attempts_list)))

def start_game():

random_number = int(random.randint(1, 10))

print("Hello traveler! Welcome to the game of guesses!")

player_name = input("What is your name? ")

wanna_play = input("Hi, {}, would you like to play the guessing game? (Enter Yes/No) ".format(player_name))

# Where the show_score function USED to be

attempts = 0

show_score()

while wanna_play.lower() == "yes":

try:

guess = input("Pick a number between 1 and 10 ")

if int(guess) < 1 or int(guess) > 10:

raise ValueError("Please guess a number within the given range")

if int(guess) == random_number:

print("Nice! You got it!")

attempts += 1

attempts_list.append(attempts)

print("It took you {} attempts".format(attempts))

play_again = input("Would you like to play again? (Enter Yes/No) ")

attempts = 0

show_score()

random_number = int(random.randint(1, 10))

if play_again.lower() == "no":

print("That's cool, have a good one!")

break

elif int(guess) > random_number:

print("It's lower")

attempts += 1

elif int(guess) < random_number:

print("It's higher")

attempts += 1

except ValueError as err:

print("Oh no!, that is not a valid value. Try again...")

print("({})".format(err))

else:

print("That's cool, have a good one!")

if __name__ == '__main__':

start_game()
 

3. Rock Paper Scissors
This rock paper scissors program uses a number of functions so this is a good way of getting that critical concept under your belt.

Random function: to generate rock, paper, or scissors. 
Valid function: to check the validity of the move.
Result function: to declare the winner of the round.
Scorekeeper: to keep track of the score.
The program requires the user to make the first move before it makes a move. The input could be a string or an alphabet representing either rock, paper or scissors. After evaluating the input string, a winner is decided by the result function and the score of the round is updated by the scorekeeper function. 

Sample Code:

""" Rock Paper Scissors

----------------------------------------

"""

import random

import os

import re

os.system('cls' if os.name=='nt' else 'clear')

while (1 < 2):

print ("\n")

print ("Rock, Paper, Scissors - Shoot!")

userChoice = input("Choose your weapon [R]ock], [P]aper, or [S]cissors: ")

if not re.match("[SsRrPp]", userChoice):

print ("Please choose a letter:")

print ("[R]ock, [S]cissors or [P]aper.")

continue

# Echo the user's choice

print ("You chose: " + userChoice)

choices = ['R', 'P', 'S']

opponenetChoice = random.choice(choices)

print ("I chose: " + opponenetChoice)

if opponenetChoice == str.upper(userChoice):

print ("Tie! ")

#if opponenetChoice == str("R") and str.upper(userChoice) == "P"

elif opponenetChoice == 'R' and userChoice.upper() == 'S':

print ("Scissors beats rock, I win! ")

continue

elif opponenetChoice == 'S' and userChoice.upper() == 'P':

print ("Scissors beats paper! I win! ")

continue

elif opponenetChoice == 'P' and userChoice.upper() == 'R':

print ("Paper beat rock, I win!")

continue

else:

print ("You win!")
